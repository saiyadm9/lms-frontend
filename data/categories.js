						<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">TEACHING &amp; LEARNING STRATEGIES FOR ENG4U</h2>
						<p><strong>In this course, students will experience the following activities.</strong></p>
						<p><strong>Presentations with embedded videos</strong> are utilized to outline concepts, explain theory with the use of examples and practice questions, and incorporate multi-media opportunities for students to learn more (e.g. online simulations, quizzes, etc.).</p>
						<p><strong>End of unit conversations and Poodlls</strong> are opportunities for students to express their ideas, problem solving, and thought processes with a teacher who provides timely feedback.</p>
						<p><strong>Reflection</strong> is an opportunity for students to look back at concepts and theories with new eyes, to relate theory to practice, and to align learning with their own values and beliefs.</p>
						<p><strong>Discussions with the instructor</strong> are facilitated through video conferencing, discussing the concepts and skills being studied. This enables two-way communication between the student and the instructor, to share ideas and ask questions in dialogue. This also helps to build a relationship between the student and instructor.</p>
						<p><strong>Instructor demonstrations</strong> (research skills, etc.) are opportunities for the instructor to lead a student through a concept or skill through video conferencing, videos, or emailing with the student.</p>
						<p><strong>Discussion forums</strong> are an opportunity for students to summarize and share their ideas and perspectives with their peers, which deepens understanding through expression. It also provides an opportunity for peer-to-peer feedback.</p>
						<p><strong>Practical extension and application</strong> of knowledge are integrated throughout the course. The goal is to help students make connections between what they learn in the classroom and how they understand and relate to the world around them and their own lives. Learning becomes a dynamic opportunity for students to be more aware that their learning is all around them and enable them to create more meaning in their lives.</p>
						<p><strong>Individual activities/assignments</strong> assessments are completed individually at a student’s own pace and are intended to expand and consolidate the learning in each lesson. Individual activities allow the teacher to accommodate interests and needs and to assess the progress of individual students. For this reason, students are encouraged to discuss IEPs (Individual Education Plans) with their teacher and to ask to modify assessments if they have a unique interest that they feel could be pursued in the assessment. The teacher plays an important role in supporting these activities by providing ongoing feedback to students, both orally and in writing.</p>
						<p><strong>Research</strong> is an opportunity to apply inquiry skills to a practical problem or question. Students perform research to gather information, evaluate quality sources, analyze findings, evaluate their analysis, and synthesize their findings into conclusions. Throughout, students apply both creative thinking and critical thinking. New questions are also developed to further learning.</p>
						<p><strong>Writing</strong> as a learning tool helps students to think critically about course material while grasping, organizing, and integrating prior knowledge with new concepts. Good communication skills are important both in and out of the classroom.</p>
						<p><strong>Brainstorming, charts, and graphs</strong> are a great way for students to synthesize their knowledge of subject matter visually through graphic organizers, pictures, and texts. Readings are an opportunity for students to gain insight from a variety of texts online and further develop literacy skills. Students may print out the reading material to use it to highlight, take notes, and have with them when a computer is not available.</p>
						<p><strong>Articles</strong> are examples of concepts and theories being discussed in the public realm and with respect to current events. They are snapshots not only of why theories/concepts/applications are relevant but also provide a window into the broader context of subject matter knowledge and understanding. Students learn through reading and analysis that the subject matter is deeply related to, and intertwined with, society and the diverse perspectives of lived experience.</p>
						<p><strong>Oral presentations</strong> in an online environment are opportunities for students to present live or record presentations, expressing their ideas and understanding orally.</p>
						<p><strong>Reflective/comparative analysis</strong> and evaluation of written work is very important in this course. Concepts and skills are modelled in examples (exemplars), which students can refer to and utilize to self-evaluate their own work. A variety of texts are shared, and students are encouraged to make comparisons with different texts, real life situations, and their own writing.</p>
						<p><strong>Journals</strong> provide an opportunity for students to self-reflect on the subject matter and see their growth over time. It supports students to express their thoughts and skills learned in a personal way.</p>

						<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">ASSESSMENT &amp; EVALUATION FOR STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT</h2>
						<p>As summarized in <i><a href="https://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/growsuccess.pdf" className="text-blue-600">Growing Success</a> 2010</i>, the primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students’ strengths and weaknesses in their achievement of the curriculum expectations in each course. This information also serves to guide teachers in adapting curriculum and instructional approaches to students’ needs and in assessing the overall effectiveness of programs and classroom practices. As part of assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback that guides their efforts towards improvement.</p>
						<p>Evaluation refers to the process of judging the quality of student work on the basis of established criteria, and assigning a value to represent that quality. All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses on students’ achievement of the overall expectations. A students’ achievement of the overall expectations is evaluated on the basis of his or her achievement of related specific expectations. Teachers will use their professional judgement to determine which specific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of overall expectations, and which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment but not necessarily evaluated.</p>
						<p>In order to ensure that assessment and evaluation are valid and reliable, and that they lead to the improvement of student learning, teachers must use assessment and evaluation strategies that:</p>
						<ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
							<li>Address both what students learn and how well they learn;</li>
							<li>Are based both on the categories of knowledge and skills and on the achievement level descriptions given in the achievement chart;</li>
							<li>Are varied in nature, administered over a period of time, and designed to provide opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning;</li>
							<li>Are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the needs and experiences of the students;</li>
							<li>Are fair to all students;</li>
							<li>Accommodate students with special education needs, consistent with the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan;</li>
							<li>Accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction;</li>
							<li>Ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement;</li>
							<li>Promote students’ ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals;</li>
							<li>Include the use of samples of students’ work that provide evidence of their achievement;</li>
							<li>Are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the school year and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The final grade will be determined as follows:</p>
						<p>❑ 70% of the grade will be based on evaluation conducted throughout the course. This portion of the grade should reflect the student’s most consistent level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration will be given to more recent evidence of achievement.</p>
						<p>❑ 30% of the grade will be based on a final evaluation administered at or towards the end of the course. This evaluation will be based on evidence from one or a combination of the following: an examination, a performance, and/or another method of evaluation suitable to the course content. The final evaluation allows the student an opportunity to demonstrate comprehensive achievement of the overall expectations for the course.</p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">TEACHING & LEARNING STRATEGIES FOR SPH4U</h2>
  <div className="space-y-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
    <p><strong>In this course, students will experience the following activities.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Presentations with embedded videos</strong> are utilized to outline concepts, explain theory with the use of examples and practice questions, and incorporate multi-media opportunities for students to learn more (e.g. online simulations, quizzes, etc.).</p>
    <p><strong>End of unit conversations and Poodlls</strong> are opportunities for students to express their ideas, problem solving, and thought processes with a teacher who provides timely feedback.</p>
    <p><strong>Reflection</strong> is an opportunity for students to look back at concepts and theories with new eyes, to relate theory to practice, and to align learning with their own values and beliefs.</p>
    <p><strong>Discussions</strong> with the instructor are facilitated through video conferencing, discussing the concepts and skills being studied. This enables two-way communication between the student and the instructor, to share ideas and ask questions in dialogue. This also helps to build a relationship between the student and instructor.</p>
    <p><strong>Instructor demonstrations</strong> (research skills, etc.) are opportunities for the instructor to lead a student through a concept or skill through video conferencing, videos, or emailing with the student.</p>
    <p><strong>Discussion forums</strong> are an opportunity for students to summarize and share their ideas and perspectives with their peers, which deepens understanding through expression. It also provides an opportunity for peer-to-peer feedback.</p>
    <p><strong>Practical extension</strong> and application of knowledge are integrated throughout the course. The goal is to help students make connections between what they learn in the classroom and how they understand and relate to the world around them and their own lives. Learning becomes a dynamic opportunity for students to be more aware that their learning is all around them and enable them to create more meaning in their lives.</p>
    <p><strong>Individual activities/assignments</strong> assessments are completed individually at a student’s own pace and are intended to expand and consolidate the learning in each lesson. Individual activities allow the teacher to accommodate interests and needs and to assess the progress of individual students.</p>
    <p>For this reason, students are encouraged to discuss <strong>IEPs (Individual Education Plans)</strong> with their teacher and to ask to modify assessments if they have a unique interest that they feel could be pursued in the assessment. The teacher plays an important role in supporting these activities by providing ongoing feedback to students, both orally and in writing.</p>
    <p><strong>Research is an opportunity</strong> to apply inquiry skills to a practical problem or question. Students perform research to gather information, evaluate quality sources, analyze findings, evaluate their analysis, and synthesize their findings into conclusions. Throughout, students apply both creative thinking and critical thinking. New questions are also developed to further learning.</p>
    <p><strong>Writing as a learning tool</strong> helps students to think critically about course material while grasping, organizing, and integrating prior knowledge with new concepts. Good communication skills are important both in and out of the classroom.</p>
    <p><strong>Virtual simulations</strong> are interactive websites that provide students with an opportunity to ask questions, explore hypotheses, relate variables, examine relationships, and make connections between theory and application in a safe environment that promotes intellectual risk taking and curiosity.</p>
    <p><strong>Virtual labs</strong> are interactive websites that provide students with an opportunity to follow a procedure to test hypotheses using scientific apparatus, gather and record observations, analyze observations using formula and relevant theory/concepts, and then formulate conclusions that relate hypotheses to analysis.</p>
    <p><strong>Diagrams</strong> are visual representations of scientific ideas and concepts. They provide another perspective to organize ideas. Visuals are thought to promote cognitive plasticity – meaning, they can help us change our minds or help us to remember an idea.</p>
    <p><strong>Graphics/images</strong> are visual representations of ideas/concepts. Visuals are thought to promote cognitive plasticity – meaning, they can help us change our minds or help us to remember an idea.</p>
    <p><strong>Charts</strong> are visual representations of scientific ideas and concepts using math that support analysis. For example, you can have a pie chart that shows Canada’s energy sources.</p>
    <p><strong>Tables</strong> involve organizing information in terms of categories (rows and columns). This helps us to understand the relationships between ideas and data, as well as highlight trends.</p>
    <p><strong>Drawings</strong> and schematics are scientific and engineering ideas explained visually. For example, an electric circuit can be explained using symbols, which makes it possible to communicate ideas universally, clearly, and succinctly.</p>
    <p><strong>Articles</strong> are examples of concepts and theories being discussed in the public realm and with respect to current events. They are snapshots not only of why scientific theories/concepts/applications are relevant but also provide a window into the broader context of scientific knowledge and understanding. Students learn through reading and analysis that science is deeply related to, and intertwined with, society and the diverse perspectives of lived experience.</p>
    <p><strong>Practice problems</strong> provide students with a scenario/problem to solve by applying concepts and skills learned in a context. This helps students to understand the relevance of their learning.</p>

    <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
      As summarized in <i><a href="https://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/growsuccess.pdf" className="text-blue-600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Growing Success</a> 2010</i>, the primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students’ strengths and weaknesses in their achievement of the curriculum expectations in each course. This information also serves to guide teachers in adapting curriculum and instructional approaches to students’ needs and in assessing the overall effectiveness of programs and classroom practices. As part of assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback that guides their efforts towards improvement.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-700">
      Evaluation refers to the process of judging the quality of student work on the basis of established criteria, and assigning a value to represent that quality. All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses on students’ achievement of the overall expectations. A student’s achievement of the overall expectations is evaluated on the basis of their achievement of related specific expectations. Teachers will use their professional judgement to determine which specific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of overall expectations, and which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment but not necessarily evaluated.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-700">
      In order to ensure that assessment and evaluation are valid and reliable, and that they lead to the improvement of student learning, teachers must use assessment and evaluation strategies that:

      <li>Are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the needs and experiences of the students;</li>
      <li>Are fair to all students;</li>
      <li>Accommodate students with special education needs, consistent with the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan;</li>
      <li>Accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction;</li>
      <li>Ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement;</li>
      <li>Promote students’ ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals;</li>
      <li>Include the use of samples of students’ work that provide evidence of their achievement;</li>
      <li>Are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the school year and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.</li>

    <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-1">
      <li>
        <strong>70%</strong> of the grade will be based on evaluation conducted throughout the course.

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>30%</strong> of the grade will be based on a final evaluation administered at or towards the end of the course.
